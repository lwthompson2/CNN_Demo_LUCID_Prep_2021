# Neural Networks #

In this week's session we will be learning about neural networks, focusing primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have become a useful tool for the development of self-driving cars, object and face recognition software, medical imaging analysis (e.g., MRI), and many other areas. These models can be simple to build using tools like TensorFlow and Pytorch, the latter of which we’ll use for our demo. Their inner workings, however, combine nearly all of the tools introduced throughout this workshop including: linear regression, regularization, optimization, and dimensionality reduction. I hope to provide a brief introduction to CNNs, give you some hands-on experience with a pre-built model and then provide some time for discussion.
